# AsteroidsBB
My middle school Exhibition Project: the Asteroids game, written using Blitz Basic

I had to write a Microsoft Word document containing my work log hours. I've copied the contents over into a text file for entertainment purposes. Note that I did this project long before I knew about revision control software.

A big thanks to Maneesh Sethi for his book "Game Programming for Teens".
